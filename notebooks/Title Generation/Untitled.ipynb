The reason for this lack of control is based at least in part on Windows′® user account system. Windows® provides administrator and non-administrator accounts. Users who have administrative privileges can generally access most or all programs on a computer. Non-administrators cannot install many types of programs, and many programs will not run in non-administrator mode. As a result, non-administrator accounts can be more secure than administrator accounts. However, options for configuring individual program access on non-administrator accounts can be limited or cumbersome to use.
